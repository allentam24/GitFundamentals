# git init

The `git init` comman is used to create an empty git repository.

If you were to create a new directory and intialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir New directory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./Status.md)
[add](./Add.md)
[commit](./Commit.md)
[push](./Push.md)
And more.

Init will create a repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
